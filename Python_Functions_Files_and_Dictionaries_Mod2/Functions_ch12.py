#%% Protecting mutable objects
"""
Make a copy of an object and pass the copy in to the function. Then return the modified 
copy and reassign it to the original variable if you want to save the changes. The
 built-in list function, which takes a sequence as a parameter and returns a new list,
 works to copy an existing list. For dictionaries, you can similarly call the dict 
 function

"""
In general, any lasting effect that occurs in a function, not through its return value, 
is called a side effect. There are three ways to have side effects:

1.Printing out a value. This doesnâ€™t change any objects or variable bindings, but it 
does have a potential lasting effect outside the function execution, because a person 
might see the output and be influenced by it.

2. Changing the value of a mutable object.

3. Changing the binding of a global variable.
