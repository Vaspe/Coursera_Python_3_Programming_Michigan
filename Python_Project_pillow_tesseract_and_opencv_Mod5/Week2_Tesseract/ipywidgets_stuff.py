# In this brief lecture I want to introduce you to one of the more advanced features of the 
# Jupyter notebook development environment called widgets. Sometimes you want
# to interact with a function you have created and call it multiple times with different
# parameters. For instance, if we wanted to draw a red box around a portion of an
# image to try and fine tune the crop location. Widgets are one way to do this quickly
# in the browser without having to learn how to write a large desktop application.
#
# Lets check it out. First we want to import the Image and ImageDraw classes from the
# PILLOW package
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

# Then we want to import the interact class from the widgets package
from ipywidgets import interact

# We will use interact to annotate a function. Lets bring in an image that we know we 
# are interested in, like the storefront image from a previous lecture
image=Image.open('readonly/storefront.png')

# Ok, our setup is done. Now we're going to use the interact decorator to indicate
# that we want to wrap the python function. We do this using the @ sign. This will
# take a set of parameters which are identical to the function to be called. Then Jupyter
# will draw some sliders on the screen to let us manipulate these values. Decorators,
# which is what the @ sign is describing, are standard python statements and just a
# short hand for functions which wrap other functions. They are a bit advanced though, so
# we haven't talked about them in this course, and you might just have to have some faith
@interact(left=100, top=100, right=200, bottom=200)

# Now we just write the function we had before
def draw_border(left, top, right, bottom):
    img=image.copy()
    drawing_object=ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    drawing_object.rectangle((left,top,right,bottom), fill = None, outline ='red')
    display(img)
    
# Jupyter widgets is certainly advanced territory, but if you would like
# to explore more you can read about what is available here:
